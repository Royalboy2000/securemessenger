## 💰 Pricing Methodology

All prices are calculated from real Kenyan market data (Jumia Kenya):

1. **Original KSH Price** (from Jumia Kenya)
2. **Convert to USD** (using exchange rate: 1 USD = 130 KSH)
3. **Add 50% Profit Margin**
4. **Final USD Price**

### Example Calculation:
- Vitron 43" TV: KSH 17,000
- ÷ 130 = $130.77 USD (base cost)
- × 1.5 = **$196.14 USD** (final price with 50% profit)
